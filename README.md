# Pre-work - _Memory Game_

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program.

Submitted by: **Yuji Oshiro**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/horse-chill-dugout

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
- [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked.
- [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked.
- [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
- [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.
- [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
- [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
- [x] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
- [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
- [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
- [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
- [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
- [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
- [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
- [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Easy mode (which uses 4 buttons) and a hard mode (which uses 6 buttons)

## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

- I read through a lot of sections on w3schools and geeks4geeks to get a further understanding of web development fundamentals.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)

- My biggest challenge was understanding the required steps without a visual reference. While the instructions and requirements were clearly laid out, it is a bit difficult to visualize the entire project and each required feature without seeing it in action first.
- Like many other programming projects, the easiest way to get over this was to just start programming. Once I was able to get a rough framework of the program, I was then able to finetune each feature so that it matched the written requirements.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)

- I'm curious to see how all of this will tie into a server. While this pre-work was only a quick demo into frontend development, it does give me a light understanding of how the frontend works and how everything should be laid out when designing components that a user will interact with. I am now excited to learn how we can connect these components with databases and information that a user does not have direct access to.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)

- One thing I would definitely do is clean up my code. There are certainly areas where the code can be more concise or easier to read. A feature I would add is the ability to play an unlimited amount of turns (not just 8), more buttons (and even a way for the player to select how many buttons they want to play with), overall better layout and more careful design of the buttons.
- I might also add an even harder game mode that doesn't give the clue on the actual button, but the clue just shows up off to the side. This would mean the player loses the ability to remember the pattern based on position of the buttons and can now only use the color and sound as a clue.
